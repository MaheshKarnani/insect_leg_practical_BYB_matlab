Changes januari 2024
* Fixed a bug that occured when the spike detector detected a spike in the first or last 20 samples of the recording, causing the code to freeze.
* Fixed continuity in the figure numbers.
* Some text surrounding the code was changed to reduce confudion and have more clear instructions.
* Placed some extra comments in the code to improve code understandability for students.
* Removed some variable boxes cleared up some variable names
* Figure axis labling was made more intuitive
* Removed question 3.
* Changed the line plot near question 13 that shows mean spike frequency against stimulus intsity (in arbitrary numbers) to a bar plot with categories.
